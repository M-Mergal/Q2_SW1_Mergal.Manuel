   		<hr>
   	<p style="color: #7E7F83;"> This music genre has been a childhood memory, is a present experience, and possibly my future. <br/> Never had I ever gone through a week without music, and majority of which is Beyonce, and Sza.</p> 

   	<h2 style="text-align: center; color: #14110F;">What makes it so fun to listen to?</h2>

   	   <ul style="list-style-type: disc; color: #14110F;"> 

   	   	<li>Groove - the music's flow gives you a steady energy. It isn't too shallow, nor is it too much to bear; just right.</li>
   	   	<li>Vibe - Similar to groove, Vibe is the general energy from the music. it could be hues of sad feelings (rhythm and <strong>blues</strong>) or mellow, calming and happy music.</li>
   	   	<li>Lyrics - The lyrics matter. Even if most R&B I listen to contain mature content, it's the art of seeing over the lyrics that make R&B so fun.</li>

   	   <pre style="font-family: sans-serifs;color: #14110F;">
                                                         
                                          Verse 2
                               I'm so mature, I'm so mature
                   I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
                            I don't want none, I just want you
                          If I can't have you, no one should
                               I might - I might kill my ex.
       </pre>

       <p style="color: #14110F;">notice the lyrics' message? for further context, the singer would find it satisfying to kill her former lover. but no one is killing anyone. that's illegal. The entire song is crafted perfectly to encompass how much it hurts to be left by someone you ove without necessarily exaggerating anything. </p>
